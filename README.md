## What It Does

This tool helps optimize industrial-scale SCP production by:
- Calculating reactor requirements based on production targets
- Analyzing cost drivers (substrate, energy, labor, overhead)
- Comparing environmental footprint vs. traditional proteins
- Determining economic viability and payback period

## Parameters You Can Adjust

- Fermentation conditions (growth rate, yield, biomass concentration)
- Production scale (reactor size, annual target)
- Economic factors (substrate price, energy cost)
